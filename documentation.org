Hussein ibn Ali is the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, who is known to have
declared *“Hussain is from me and I am from Hussain; God loves whoever loves Hussain.”*

He is honoured as “The Chief of Martyrs” for his selfless stand for social justice
against Yazid, the corrupt 7ᵗʰ caliph. The Karbala Massacre is commemorated annually
in the first Islamic month, Muharram, as a reminder to stand against oppression and tyranny;
Jesus Christ, son of Mary, makes an indirect appearance in the story.

A terse summary of the chain of events leading to the massacre may be found at
https://www.al-islam.org/articles/karbala-chain-events.

An elegant English recitation recounting the Karbala Massacre may be found at
https://youtu.be/2i9Y3Km6h08 ---“Arbaeen Maqtal - Sheikh Hamam Nassereddine - 1439”.

 *Charles Dickens:* /“If Hussain had fought to quench his worldly desires...then I/
/do not understand why his sister, wife, and children accompanied him. It stands
to reason therefore, that he sacrificed purely for Islam.”/

*Gandhi:* /“I learned from Hussain how to achieve victory while being oppressed.”/

*Thomas Carlyle:* /“The victory of Hussein, despite his minority, marvels me.”/

*Thomas Masaryk:* /“Although our clergies also move us while describing the
Christ's sufferings, but the zeal and zest that is found in the followers of/
/Hussain will not be found in the followers of Christ. And it seems that the
suffering of Christ against the suffering of Hussain is like a blade of straw/ /in
front of a huge mountain.”/

# Graphs containing /no/ isolated points are characterised by $(R ∪ R˘) ⨾ ⊤ = ⊤$.
doc:graph
#+begin_documentation Graph :show t :color blue
A /(Partial, resp. Total) Graph/ $G = (V, E, src, tgt)$ consists of
   + $V$, a set of “points, nodes, vertices”
   + $E$, a set of “arcs, edges”
   + $src, tgt : E ↔ V$, a pair of /partial (resp. total)/ functions.

⟦ Tersely put, in any category, a /graph/ is a parallel pair of morphisms. ⟧

/Edge parallelism/ is the relation $Ξ = src ⨾ src ˘ ∩ tgt ⨾ tgt˘$; two arcs are
related when they have the same starting point and the same ending point, which
both exist. Joyously, the name ‘Ξ’ is a neat reminder of the concept:
The name is three parallel lines, for the concept of edge(line) parallelism.

+ A graph is /total/ exactly when /Id ⊆ Ξ/; and so Ξ is an equivalence.
+ A graph has /no parallel arrows/ exactly when /Ξ ⊆ Id/.
+ A graph is /simple/ exactly when /Ξ = Id/.

The /associated relation/ is the relation /_⟶_ = src ˘ ⨾ tgt/ that relates two nodes
when the first is the source of some edge that happens to have the second point
as its target. One uses the associated relation to study properties not
involving partial or parallel arrows. One writes /⟵/ for /⟶˘/;
one writes ⟶⋆ for the /reachability/ relation.

+ Node /y/ is /reachable via a non-empty path/ from node /x/ exactly when /x ⟶⁺ y/.
  - Node /x/ lies on a cycle exactly when /x ⟶⁺ x/.
  - A graph is /DAG, acylic, circuit-free,/ exactly when /⟶⁺ ⊆ ∼Id/; i.e., /⟶⁺ ∩ Id = ⊥/.
  - An acyclic graph is a (/directed) forest/ exactly when ⟶ is injective; i.e.,
    every node has at most one predecessor; i.e., $⟶ ⨾ ⟵ ⊆ Id$.
+ A node /r/ is a /root/ exactly when every node is reachable from it; i.e., /{r} × V ⊆ ⟶⋆;/
  i.e., /𝕃 r ⨾ ⟶⋆ = ⊤/ where /𝕃 r/ is defined by $𝕃 r = (ℝ r)˘$ and $x 〔ℝ r〕 y \;≡\; x = r$.
  - $x〔𝕃 r ⨾ R〕 y \;≡\; r〔R〕 y$ and $x 〔R ⨾ ℝ r〕 y \;≡\; x 〔R〕 r$
  - A /tree/ is a forest with a root.
+ A graph is /loop free/ exactly when /⟶ ⊆ ∼Id/.
+ A graph is /strongly connected/ exactly when /⟶⋆ = ⊤/; i.e., /∼Id ⊆ ⟶⁺/;
  i.e., every point is reachable from any /other/ point; i.e., /∼Id ⊆ ⟶ ∩ ⟵˘/;
  i.e., any two distinct points lie on an undirected circuit.
  - The equivalence classes of /⟶⋆ ∩ ⟵⋆/ are the /strongly connected components/.
+ /Terminal∣sinks/ are nodes from which it is /not/ possible to proceed /any/ further;
  i.e., terminals have no successors; the domain of /∼(⟶ ⨾ ⊤)/ is all terminals.
+ /Initial∣sources/ are nodes from which it is /not/ possible to proceed backward;
  i.e., initials have no predecessors; the domain of /∼(⟵ ⨾ ⊤)/ is all initials.
#+end_documentation

doc:Expression
#+begin_documentation Expression :show t

An /expression/ is either a ‘variable’ or a ‘function application’; i.e., the name
of a function along with a number of existing expressions.

#+begin_example
 Expr ::= Constant    -- E.g., 1 or “apple”
      |  Variable    -- E.g., x or apple (no quotes!)
      |  Application -- E.g., f(x₁, x₂, …, xₙ)
#+end_example

( One reads ‘:=’ as /becomes/ and so the addition of an extra colon results in a
‘stutter’: One reads ‘∷=’ as /be-becomes/. The symbol ‘|’ is read /or/. )

Notice that a constant is really just an application with /n/ being /0/ arguments
and so the first line in the definition above could be omitted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a sense, an expression is like a sentence with the variables acting as
pronouns and the function applications acting as verb clauses and the argument
to the application are the participants in the action of the verbal clause.

A *variable of type τ* is a /name/ denoting a yet unknown /value/ of type τ;
i.e., “it is a pronoun (nickname) referring to a person in the collection of people τ”.
E.g., to say $x$ is an integer variable means that we may treat it
as if it were a number whose precise value is unknown.
Then, if we let =Expr τ= refer to the expressions denoting /values/ of type τ;
then a *meta-variable* is simply a normal variable of type =Expr τ=.

That is, when we write phrases like =“Let E be an expression”=, then the /name/ $E$
varies and so is a variable, but it is an expression and so may consist of a
function application or a variable. *That is, $E$ is a variable that may stand
for variables.* This layered inception is resolved by referring to $E$ as not
just any normal variable, but instead as a *meta-variable*: A variable capable of
referring to other (simpler) variables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expressions, as defined above, are also known as /abstract syntax trees/ (AST) or
/prefix notation/. Then /textual substitution/ is known as ‘grafting trees’ (a
monadic bind).

Their use can be clunky, such as by requiring many parentheses and implicitly
forcing a syntactic distinction between equivalent expressions; e.g.,
/gcd(m,gcd(n,p))/ and /gcd(gcd(m,n),p)/ look difference even though /gcd/ is
associative.

As such, one can declare /precedence levels/ ---a.k.a. /binding power/--- to reduce
parentheses, one can declare fixity ---i.e., have arguments around operation
names---, and, finally, one can declare association ---whether sequential
instances of an operation should be read with implicit parenthesis to the right
or the to the left--- to reduce syntactic differences.  The resulting expression
are now known to be in a /concrete syntax/ ---i.e., in a syntactic shape that is
more concrete.

That is, the *conventions* on how a /string/ should be parsed as a /tree/ are known as a
*precedence, fixity, and associativity rules.*

Similarly, not for operators but one treats /relations/ *conjunctionally* to reduce
the number of ‘and’(∧) symbols; e.g. $x ≤ y + 2 = z \quad≡\quad x ≤ (y + 2) \,∧\, (y + 2) = z$.
This is very useful to avoid repeating lengthy common expressions, such as /y + 2/.

doc:Induction
#+begin_documentation Induction :show t :color blue
How we prove a theorem $P\, n$ ranging over natural numbers $n$?

For instance, suppose the property $P$ is that using only 3 and 5 dollar bills,
any amount of money that is at-least 8 dollars can be formed.

Since there are an infinite number of natural numbers, it is not possibly to
verify $P\, n$ is true by /evaluating/ $P\, n$ at each natural number $n$.

*Knocking over dominos is induction:*
The natural numbers are like an infinite number of dominoes ---i.e., standing
tiles one after the other, in any arrangement. Can all dominoes be knocked over?
That is, if we construe $P\, n$ to mean “the /n/-th domino can be knocked over”,
then the question is “is $∀ n • P\, n$ true”. Then, clearly if we can knock over
the first domino, $P\, 0$, and if when a domino is knocked over then it also
knocks over the next domino, $P\, n ⇒ P\, (n + 1)$, then ‘clearly’ all dominoes
will be knocked over. This ‘basic observation’ is known as /induction/.

*Climbing a ladder is induction:*
The natural numbers are like an infinite ladder ascending to heaven.  Can we
reach every step, rung, on the ladder?  That is, if we construe $P\, n$ to mean
“the /n/-th rung is reachable”, then the question is “is $∀ n • P\, n$
true”. Then, clearly if we can reach the first rung, $P\, 0$, and whenever we
climb to a rung then we can reach up and grab the next rung, $P\, n ⇒ P\, (n +
1)$, then ‘clearly’ all rungs of the ladder can be reached. This ‘basic
observation’ is known as /induction/.

*Constant functions are induction:*
A predicate $P : ℕ → 𝔹$ is a function. When is such a function constantly the
value $\true$? That is, when is $∀ n • P\, n = \true$?  Clearly, if $P$ starts
off being $\true$ ---i.e., /P 0/--- and it preserves truth at every step ---i.e.,
/P n ⇒ P (n + 1)/--- then /P n/ will be true for any choice of $n$.

That is, if we consider $(ℕ, ≤)$ and $(𝔹, ⇒)$ as ordered sets and $P$ starts at
the ‘top’ of 𝔹 ---i.e., /P 0 = true/--- and it is ascending ---i.e., /P n ⇒ P (n +
1)/--- and so ‘never goes down’, then clearly it must stay constantly at the top
value of 𝔹. This ‘basic observation’ is known as /induction/.


⟦ For the money problem, we need to start somewhere else besides 0. ⟧

*Principle of (“Weak”) Mathematical Induction:*
To show that a property $P$ is true for all natural numbers starting with some
number $n_0$, show the following two properties:
+ Base case :: Show that $P\, n₀$ is true.
+ Inductive Step :: Show that whenever (the *inductive hypothesis*) $n$ is a
  natural number that such that $n ≥ n₀$ and $P\, n$ is true, then $P\, (n + 1)$
  is also true.

⟦ For the money problem, we need to be able to use the fact that to prove
$P\,(n + 1)$ we must have already proven $P$ for all smaller values. ⟧

*Principle of (“Strong”) Mathematical Induction*:
To show that a property $P$ is true for all natural numbers starting with some
number $n_0$, show the following two properties:
+ Base case :: Show that $P\, n₀$ is true.
+ Inductive Step :: Show that whenever (the *inductive hypothesis*) $n$ is a
  natural number that such that $n ≥ n₀$ and $P\, n_0, P\, (n_0 + 1), P\, (n_0 +
  2), …, P\, n$ are true, then $P\, (n + 1)$ is also true.

⟦ The ‘strength’ of these principles refers to the strength of the inductive
hypothesis. The principles are provably equivalent. ⟧

# (It is also a way to say that ℕ has non-empty meets.)
*The Least Number Principle (LNP) ---Another way to see induction:*
Every non-empty subset of the natural numbers must have a least element,
‘obviously’. This is (strong) induction.
# Possibly infinite!

Application of LNP to showing that algorithms terminate:
In particular, every decreasing non-negative sequence of integers
$r₀ > r₁ > r₂ > ⋯$ must terminate.

doc:Textual_Substitution
#+begin_documentation  Textual_Substitution :show t
The *(simultaneous textual) Substitution operation* $E[\vec x ≔ \vec F]$ replaces
all variables $\vec x$ with parenthesised expressions $\vec F$ in an expression
$E$. In particular, $E[x ≔ F]$ is just $E$ but with all occurrences of $x$
replaced by $“(F)”$. This is the “find-and-replace” utility you use on your
computers.

Textual substitution on expressions is known as “grafting” on trees: Evaluate
$E[x ≔ F]$ by going down the tree $E$ and finding all the ‘leaves’ labelled $x$,
cut them out and replace them with the new trees $F$.

Since expressions are either variables of functions applications,
substitution can be defined inductively/recursively by the following two clauses:

+ /y[x ≔ F]             =  if  x = y  then  F  else  y  fi/
+ /f(t₁, …, tₙ)[x ≔ F]  =  f(t₁′, …, tₙ′)   where  tᵢ′ = tᵢ[x ≔ F]/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sequential ≠ Simultaneous:
  /(x + 2 · y)[x ≔ y][y ≔ x]  ≠  (x + 2 · y)[x, y ≔ y, x]/

[[https://alhassy.github.io/PythonCheatSheet/CheatSheet.pdf][Python]], for example, has simultaneous /assignment/;
e.g., ~x, y = y, x~ is used to swap the value of two variables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A /function/ $f$ is a rule for computing a value from another value.

If we define $f\, x = E$ using an expression, then /function application/ can be
defined using textual substitution: $f \, X = E[x ≔ X]$. That is, expressions
can be considered functions of their variables ---but it is still expressions
that are the primitive idea, the building blocks.

#+end_documentation

doc:Inference_Rule
#+begin_documentation Inference_Rule :show t

Formally, a “proof” is obtained by applying a number of “rules” to known results
to obtain new results; a “theorem” is the conclusion of a “proof”.  An “axiom”
is a rule that does not need to be applied to any existing results: It's just a
known result.

That is, a *rule* $R$ is a tuple $P₁, …, Pₙ, C$ that is thought of as ‘taking
*premises* (instances of known results) $Pᵢ$’ and acting as a ‘natural,
reasonable justification’ to obtain *conclusion* $C$.  A *proof system* is a
collection of rules. At first sight, this all sounds very abstract and rather
useless, however it is a /game/: *Starting from rules, what can you obtain?* Some
games can be very fun! Another way to see these ideas is from the view of
programming:

+ Proving ≈ Programming
+ Logic   ≈ Trees (algebraic data types, 𝒲-types)
+ Rules   ≈ Constructors
+ Proof   ≈ An application of constructors
+ Axiom   ≈ A constructor with no arguments

Just as in elementary school one sees addition ‘+’ as a fraction with the
arguments above the horizontal line and their sum below the line, so too is that
notation reused for inference rules: Premises are above the fraction's bar and
the conclusion is below.
#+begin_example
                                   12
P₁, P₂, …, Pn                    +  7
---------------R     versues     ----
      C                            19
#+end_example

Just as there are meta-variables and meta-theorems, there is ‘meta-syntax’:
- The use of a fraction to delimit premises from conclusion is a form of ‘implication’.
- The use of a comma, or white space, to separate premises is a form of ‘conjunction’.

If our expressions actually have an implication and conjunction operation, then
inference rule above can be presented as an axiom $P₁ \,∧\, ⋯ \,∧\, Pₙ \,⇒\, C$.

The inference rule says “if the $Pᵢ$ are all valid, i.e., true in /all states/,
then so is $C$”; the axiom, on the other hand, says “if the $Pᵢ$ are true in /a
state/, then $C$ is true in /that state/.” Thus the rule and the axiom are not
quite the same.

Moreover, the rule is not a Boolean expression.  Rules are thus more general,
allowing us to construct systems of reasoning that have no concrete notions of
‘truth’ ---e.g., the above arithmetic rule says from the things above the
fraction bar, using the operation ‘+’, we /can get/ the thing below the bar, but
that thing (19) is not ‘true’ as we may think of conventional truth.

Finally, the rule asserts that $C$ follows from $P₁, …, Pₙ$.  The formula $P₁
\,∧\, ⋯ \,∧\, Pₙ \,⇒\, C$, on the other hand, is an expression (but it need not
be a theorem).

A “theorem” is a syntactic concept: Can we play the game of moving symbols to
get this? Not “is the meaning of this true”!  ‘Semantic concepts’ rely on
‘states’, assignments of values to variables so that we can ‘evaluate, simplify’
statements to deduce if they are true.

Syntax is like static analysis; semantics is like actually running the program
(on some, or all possible inputs).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One reads/writes a /natural deduction proof (tree)/ from the very *bottom*: Each
line is an application of a rule of reasoning, whose assumptions are above the
line; so read/written upward.  The *benefit* of this approach is that *rules guide
proof construction*; i.e., it is goal-directed.

However the *downsides are numerous*:
- So much horizontal space is needed even for simple proofs.
- One has to *repeat* common subexpressions; e.g., when using transitivity of equality.
- For comparison with other proof notations, such as Hilbert style,
  see [[http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~logicE/misc/logicE_intro.pdf][Equational Propositional Logic]].

  This is more ‘linear’ proof format; also known as /equational style/ or
  /calculational proof/. This corresponds to the ‘high-school style’ of writing a
  sequence of equations, one on each line, along with hints/explanations of how
  each line was reached from the previous line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, an inference rule says that it is possible to start with the givens
$Pᵢ$ and obtain as result $C$.  The idea to use *inference rules as computation*
is witnessed by the [[https://alhassy.github.io/PrologCheatSheet/CheatSheet.pdf][Prolog]] programming language.

A /logic/ is a formal system of reasoning...

A /logic/ is a set of symbols along with a set of /formulas/ formed from the
symbols, and a set of /inference rules/ which allow formulas to be derived from
other formulas. (The formulas may or may not include a notion of variable.)

Logics are purely syntactic objects; an /inference rule/ is a syntactic mechanism
for deriving “truths” or “theorems”.

In general, proofs are evidence of truth of a claim; by demonstrating that the
claim follows from some /obvious truth/ using rules of reasoning that /obviously

#+begin_documentation Theorem :show t :color blue
A /theorem/ is a syntactic object, a string of symbols with a particular property.

A /theorem/ of a calculus is either an axiom or the conclusion of an inference
rule whose premises are theorems.

Different axioms could lead to the same set of theorems, and many texts use
different axioms.

A *meta-theorem* is a general statement about our logic that we prove to be
true. That is, if 𝑬 is collection of rules that allows us to find truths, then a
/theorem/ is a truth found using those rules; whereas a meta-theorem/ is property
of 𝑬 itself, such as what theorems it can have.  That is, theorems are _in_ 𝑬 and
meta-theorems are _about_ 𝑬.  For example, here is a meta-theorem that the
equational logic 𝑬 has (as do many other theories, such as lattices): An
/equational/ theorem is true precisely when its ‘dual’ is true. Such metatheorems
can be helpful to discover new theorems.

# A meta-theorem is a theorem about theorems.

doc:Metatheorem
#+begin_documentation Metatheorem :show t
A /theorem/ in the technical sense is an expression derived
from axioms using inference rules.

A /metatheorem/ is a general *statement* about a logic that
one argues to be *true*.

For instance, “any two theorems are equivalent” is a statement that speaks about
expressions which happen to be theorems. A logic may not have the linguistic
capability to speak of its own expressions and so the statement may not be
expressible as an expression *within* the logic ---and so cannot be a theorem of
the logic.

For instance, the logic 𝒑𝑞 has expressions formed from the symbols “𝒑”, “𝒒”, and
“-” (dash). It has the axiom schema $x𝒑-𝒒x-$ and the rule “If $x𝒑y𝒒z$ is a theorem
then so is $x-𝒑y-𝒒z-$”. Notice that $x, y, z$ are /any/ strings of dashes;
the language of this logic does not have variables and so cannot even speak
of its own expressions, let alone its own theorems!

[Informal] theorems about [technical, logic-specific] theorems are thus termed
‘metatheorems’.

operations one can perform. However, abstractions don't, by themselves, “mean”
anything! E.g., for Haskell, the ~Monad~ type class does not mean anything, but
for the ~Maybe~ implementation it means short-circuit sequencing and for the ~List~
implementation it means (possibly nested) iteration.
Abstractions for operations are also known as “design patterns”.
( With judicious use of Yoneda, things always denote/mean certain actions. )
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An expression can contain variables, and evaluating such an expression requires
knowing what values to use for these variables; i.e., a *state*: A list of
variables with associated values. E.g., evaluation of $x - y + 2$ in the state
consisting of $(x, 5)$ and $(y, 6)$ is performed by replacing $x$ and $y$ by
their values to yield $5 - 6 + 2$ and then evaluating that to yield $1$.

A Boolean expression $P$ is *satisfied* in a state if its value is /true/ in that
state; $P$ is *satisfiable* if there is a state in which it is satisfied; and $P$
is *valid* (or is a *tautology*) if it is satisfied in every state.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often operations are defined by how they are evaluated (*operationally*), we can
take the alternative route of defining operations by how they can be manipulated
(*axiomatically*); i.e., by what properties they satisfy.

For example, evaluation of the expression $X = Y$ in a state yields the value
/true/ if expressions $X$ and $Y$ have the same value and yields /false/ if they
have different values.  This characterisation of equality is in terms of
expression /evaluation/.  For /reasoning about expressions/, a more useful
characterisation would be a set of /laws/ that can be used to show that two
expressions are equal, *without* calculating their values.
--- c.f., static analysis versues running a program.

For example, you know that $x = y$ equals $y = x$, regardless of the values of
$x$ and $y$.  A collection of such laws can be regarded as a definition of
equality, *provided* two expressions have the same value in all states precisely
when one expression can be translated into the other according to the laws.

Usually, in /a/ logic, theorems correspond to expressions that are true in all
states.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is, instead of defining expressions by how they are evaluated, we may
define expressions in terms of how they can be manipulated ---c.f., a calculus.

For instance, we may define basic manipulative properties of operators ---i.e.,
/axioms/--- by considering how the operators behave operationally on particular
expressions. That is, one may use an operational, intuitive, approach to obtain
an axiomatic specification (characterisation, interface) of the desired
properties.

More concretely, since $(p ≡ q) ≡ r$ and $p ≡ (q ≡ r)$ evaluate to
the same value for any choice of values for $p, q, r$, we may insist that a part
of the definition of equivalence is that it be an associative operation.

Sometimes a single axiom is not enough to ‘pin down’ a unique operator ---i.e.,
to ensure we actually have a well-defined operation--- and other times this is
cleanly possible; e.g., given an ordering ‘≤’(‘⇒, ⊆, ⊑’) we can define minima
‘↓’ (‘∧, ∩, ⊓’) by the axiom: “x ↓ y is the greatest lower bound”;
i.e., $z ≤ x ↓ y \quad≡\quad z ≤ x \,∧\, z ≤ y$.

#+begin_documentation Calculational Proof :show t
A story whose events have smooth transitions connecting them.

# A proof wherein each step is connected to the next step by an explicit
# justification.

This is a ‘linear’ proof format; also known as /equational style/ or /calculational
proof/. This corresponds to the ‘high-school style’ of writing a sequence of
equations, one on each line, along with hints/explanations of how each line was
reached from the previous line. ( This is similar to *programming* which
encourages placing /comments/ to /communicate/ what's going on to future readers. )

The structure of equational proofs allows implicit use of infernece rules
Leibniz, Transitvitity & Symmetry & Reflexivity of equality, and
Substitution. In contrast, the structure of proof trees is no help in this
regard, and so all uses of inference rules must be mentioned explicitly.

For comparison with other proof notations see [[http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~logicE/misc/logicE_intro.pdf][Equational Propositional Logic]].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We advocate /calculational proofs/ in which reasoning is goal directed and
justified by simple axiomatic laws that can be checked syntactically rather than
semantically. ---/Program Construction/ by Roland Backhouse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculational proofs introduce notation and recall theorems as needed, thereby
making each step of the argument easy to verify and follow. Thus, such arguments
are more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the problem domain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of a formal approach let us keep track of when our statements are
equivalent (“=”) rather than being weakened (“⇒”). That is, the use of English
to express the connection between steps is usually presented naturally using “if
this, then that” statements ---i.e., implication--- rather than stronger notion
of equality.

doc:Associative
#+begin_documentation Associative :show t :color blue
An operation _⊕_ is associative when it satisfies $(p ⊕ q) ⊕ r = p ⊕ (q ⊕ r)$.

Associativity allows us to be informal and insert or delete pairs of
parentheses in sequences of ⊕'s, just as we do with sequences of
additions ---e.g., $a + b + c + d$ is equivalent to $a + (b + c) + d$.

Hence, we can write $p ⊕ q ⊕ r$ instead of $(p ⊕ q) ⊕ r$ or $p ⊕ (q ⊕ r)$.

When an operation is associative, it is best to avoid “making a choice” of how
sequences of ⊕ should be read, by using parentheses ---unless to make things
clear or explicit for manipulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More generally, for any two operations _⊕_ and _⊞_, the “(left to right) mutual
associativity of ⊕ and ⊞” is the property $(x ⊕ y) ⊞ z = x ⊕ (y ⊞ z)$. It allows
us to omit parentheses in mixed sequences of ⊕ and ⊞. For instance, addition and
subtraction are (left to right) mutually associative.

#+end_documentation

doc:Identity
#+begin_documentation Identity :show t
An operation _⊕_ has identity 𝑰 when it satisfies $𝑰 ⊕ x = x = x ⊕ 𝑰$.

If it satisfies only the first equation, $𝑰 ⊕ x = x$, one says
that “𝑰 is a left-identity for ⊕”. If it satisfies only the second
equation, $x ⊕ 𝑰 = x$, one says that “𝑰 is a right-identity for ⊕”.

For example, implication only has a left identity, $(false ⇒ x) = x$, and
subtraction only has a right identity, $(x - 0) = x$.

An identity implies that occurrences of “⊕ 𝑰” and “𝑰 ⊕” in an expression are
redundant. Thus, $x ⊕ 𝑰$ may be replaced by $x$ in any expression without
changing the value of the expression. Therefore, we usually eliminate such
occurrences unless something encourages us to leave them in.

and
“right-distributivity” $(y ⊕ z) ⊗ x = (y ⊗ x) ⊕ (z ⊗ x)$.

When ⊕ = ⊗, one says that the operation is “self-distributive”.

Distributivity can be viewed in two ways, much like distributivity of
multiplication × over addition +. Replacing the left side by the right side
could be called “multiplying out”; replacing the right side by the left side,
“factoring”.

As a simple graph, transitivity means /paths can always be shortened (but
nonempty)./

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the shunting rule, transitivity can be read as a *‘monotonicity’* property for
the operation that turns a value /x/ into the proposition /a ⊑ x/; this maps ordered
relationships /b ⊑ c/ to ordered propositions /a ⊑ b ⇒ a ⊑ c/.

Likewise, transitivity can be read as an ‘*antitonicity*’ property for the
operation mapping a value /x/ to the proposition /x ⊑ c/; this maps ordered
relationships /a ⊑ b/ to ordered propositions /b ⊑ c ⇒ a ⊑ c/.

As a simple graph, symmetry means the graphs is /undirected/.

That is, as graphs, symmetric relations contains either exactly two arrows ---in
opposite directions--- between any two elements or none at all.  As such, for
clarity, one prefers “squeezing any two arrows in opposite directions” into one
‘undirected’ line and so obtains *undirected graphs*.
- Undirected edges represent pairs of arrows pointing in opposite directions.

If it is additionally /antisymmetric/, one says we have an *order*.
- The relation $R ∩ R˘$ is the greatest equivalence contained in a preorder $R$.

  Indeed, it's clearly symmetric and reflexive, and transitive since ‘⨾’
  sub-distributes over ‘∩’ and /R/ and /R˘/ are transitive. Then, for any
  equivalence /Ξ ⊆ R/, we have /Ξ = Ξ ˘ ⊆ R ˘/ and so /Ξ ⊆ R ∩ R˘/.

Instead of reflexivity, if we have irreflexivity we get *strict order*:
  $R$ is a strict order
≡ $R$ is transitive and irreflexive
≡ $R ⨾ R ⊆ R ⊆ ∼Id$
≡ $R ⨾ R ⊆ R \;∧\; R˘ ⊆ ∼ R$
≡ $R ⨾ R ⊆ R \;∧\; R ∩ R˘ ⊆ ⊥$
≡ $R$ is transitive and asymmetric

( /Warning!/ A “strict order” is not an order that is somehow strict. )

Orders and strict orders come in pairs: Every order $R$ induces a strict order
$R ∩ ∼Id$; conversely, every strict order $R$ gives rise to an order $R ∪
Id$. As such, it is customary to denote order relations by symbols such as ≤,
⊆. ≼, ⊑ and their associated strict orders by related symbols <, ⊂, ≺, ⊏,
respectively, with *lack the horizontal line ‘─’ below the symbol to indicate
irreflexivity ---i.e., the line is a suggestive reminder of equality.

When letters are used to denote orders, one may see /E/ for an order since it is
reminiscent of ≤ and ⊆, and may see /C/ for a strict order since it is reminiscent
of < and ⊂.

Using ‘≤’ for /an arbitrary order/ is not ideal since readers may confuse it with
the familiar /linear/ orders for numbers.

same, not by using equality, but by using an equivalence relation.  ( This
equivalence relation is obtained using transitive closure as $(R ⨾ R)^*$ where
$R$ is the evaluation, reduction relation. )

In general, “sharing the same feature 𝒇” is an equivalence relation.

Any linear ordering /E/, with associated strict order /C/, satisfies $C˘ = ∼E$;
i.e., any linear order ‘⊑’ satisfies $∀ x, y •\quad ¬ (x ⊑ y) \;≡\; y ⊏ x$.

Likewise, for liner order, we have /transitivity E⨾C⨾E = C/ and /weakening C ⊆ E/;
i.e., $a ⊑ b ⊏ c ⊑ d \;⇒\; a ⊏ d \quad\; and\; \quad x ⊏ y \;⇒\; x ⊑ y$.

Every order /E/ can be extended to a linear order /E′/; i.e., /E ⊆ E′/.  For the
finite case this is known as /topological sort/, and for the infinite case this is
known as the /Szpilrajn extension/.

- For the finite case, the /idea/ is as follows: If /E/ is not linear, then there
  are two incomparable elements /x, y/ (i.e., outside /E ∪ E˘/), so we may define
  /an/ ordering /E₁ ≔ E ∪ {(x, y)}/. We iterate this process and /Eₙ/ will
  eventually become linear.

  This process maintains “the order /E/, less the incomparable elements, is
  linear” invariant throughout. Since each step reduces the number of
  incomparable elements, it must terminate, and the invariant then ensures the
  resulting order is linear. (•̀ᴗ•́)و

also have $∼(R ⨾ S) = R ⨾ ∼ S ∪ ∼(R ⨾ ⊤)$; e.g., the people who do “not (own an
Audi car)” are exactly the people who “(own a non-Audi car) or do not(own any
car)” ---assuming a person can own at most one car.

For a map $f$, the 6th row becomes: $f(A ∩ B) \;=\; f(A) ∩ f(B)$, using
conventional direct image notation; i.e., for a function, /the preimage of an
intersection is the intersection of preimages/.

Likewise, for a map $f$, we have /the intersection of $B$ with a function's image
is the same as the image of an intersection involving the preimage of $B$/; i.e.,
$f(A) ∩ B = f(A ∩ f^{-1}(B))$.

A relation $R : V → V$ can be visualised as a drawing: A dot for each element
$x$ of $V$, and a directed line $x ⟶ y$ between two points exactly when $x 〔R〕
y$. That is relations are /simple graphs/; one refers to the directed lines
as /edges/ and the dots as /nodes/.

As a simple graph, totality means: /Every node has at least one outgoing edge/.

   $R$ is total
≡  /∀ x • ∃ y • x 〔 R 〕 y/
≡  $⊤ = R ⨾ ⊤$ (“defined everywhere”)
≡  $⊥ = ∼ (R ⨾ ⊤)$
≡  $Id ⊆ R ⨾ R ˘$
≡  $∼ R \;⊆\; R ⨾ ∼ Id$
≡  $∀ S • ∼ (R ⨾ S) \;⊆\; R ⨾ ∼ S$
≡  $∀ Q • Q ⨾ R = ⊥ ≡ Q = ⊥$

Where /⨾, ⊤, ⊥, Id, ˘, ∼/ are relation composition, the universal relation, the
empty relation, the identity relation, relation converse (transpose), and complement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The formula $∼ R \;⊆\; R ⨾ ∼ Id$ reads “If /x/ is not /R/-related to y, then /x/ is /R/
related to some element different from /y/.”  It continues to hold when we replace
the identity by an arbitrary relation.

The final formula says that $R$ is post-annihilated by the empty relation only.

Note: $∼(R ⨾ ⊤) = ⊤ \;≡\; R = ⊥$, for any $R$; i.e., /the complement of a
relation's domain is everything precisely when the relation is empty./

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final rule says /the preimage of the complement is the complement of the
preimage/; or, using conventional direct image notation, $f⁻¹(∼ A) \;=\; ∼
f⁻¹(A)$.

In conventional direct image notation, this amount to a Galois connection: $A ⊆
f⁻¹(B) \quad≡\quad f(A) ⊆ B$.

A mapping is so very close to being invertible since mappings $F$ always
satisfy: $F ˘ ⨾ F ⊆ Id$ and $Id ⊆ F ⨾ F˘$.

Shunting rule:* If $F$ is a map, then $R ⊆ S ⨾ F ˘ \quad≡\quad R ⨾ F ⊆ S$.

More generally, given an equivalence Ξ, if relation /F/ is total and Ξ-univalent
---i.e., /F˘ ⨾ F ⊆ Ξ/--- and if /S/ is Ξ-target-saturated ---i.e., /S ⨾ Ξ = S/---
then $R ⊆ S ⨾ F ˘ \quad≡\quad R ⨾ F ⊆ S$.

This property generalises injectivity, univalence, and equivalence...

Recall,
- Univalent: Every source value /x/ is associated *at most one* target value /y/.
    + I.e., if /x/ goes to /y/ and /y′/ then /y = y′/.
    + I.e., $∀ x, y′, y •\quad  x 〔R〕 y  〔R˘〕 x 〔R〕 y′ \;⇒\; y 〔Id〕 y′$
- Injective: Every source value /y/ is associated *at most* one source value /x/.
    + I.e., if /y/ comes from /x/ and /x′/ then /x = x′/.
    + I.e., $∀ x, x′, y •\quad  x 〔R〕 y  〔R˘〕 x′ 〔R〕 y \;⇒\; x 〔Id〕 x′$
- Equivalence: Any given equivalence classes are either identical or disjoint.
      # + I.e., $∀ x, y •\quad  x 〔R〕 y  〔R˘〕 x 〔R〕 y′ \;⇒\; x 〔R〕 y′$
    + Moreover, it is a /homogenous/ relation.

 Now, a /possibly heterogenous/ relation /R/ is /difunctional/ exactly when
 $∀ x, x′, y′, y •\quad  x 〔R〕 y  〔R˘〕 x′ 〔R〕 y′ \;⇒\; x 〔R〕 y′$.
 That is, $R ⨾ R ˘ ⨾ R ⊆ R$; in-fact we have equality $R ⨾ R ˘ ⨾ R = R$.
 Using Schröder, this amounts to $R ⨾ ∼R ˘ ⨾ R \;⊆\; ∼R$.

 Clearly, converse preserves difunctionality.

 For difunctional /R/,
 1. /R ⨾ (Q ∩ R˘ ⨾ S) = R ⨾ Q ∩ R ⨾ R˘ ⨾ S/
 2. $R ⨾ ∼(R ˘ ⨾ Q) \;=\; R ⨾ ⊤ ∩ ∼(R ⨾ R˘ Q)$
 3. $∼(R ⨾ R ˘ ⨾ Q) \;=\; R ⨾ ∼(R˘ ⨾ Q) ∪ ∼(R ⨾ ⊤)$
 4. $R ⨾ ∼(R ˘ ⨾ Q) \;=\; ∼(R ⨾ R˘ Q)$, if /R/ is also total.

Where /⨾, ⊤, ⊥, Id, ˘, ∼/ are relation composition, the universal relation, the
empty relation, the identity relation, relation converse (transpose), and complement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The equivalence target-saturation of a univalent relation is difunctional; i.e.,
if /R/ is univalent and Ξ is an equivalence, then $R ⨾ Ξ$ is difunctional.
