  It can be annoying to make readers jump to the bottom of the page to
  read a footnote.  Instead, I prefer to write an /inline [[doc:org-block/remark][remark]]/
  containing, say, references or additional explanation.

     /[[remark:Allah][The God of Abraham; known as Elohim in the Bible]] does not burden a
         soul beyond what it can bear./ --- Quran 2:286

  Or, without specifying an explicit label:

     /Allah[[remark:][The God of Abraham; known as Elohim in the Bible]] does not
         burden a soul beyond what it can bear./ --- Quran 2:286
