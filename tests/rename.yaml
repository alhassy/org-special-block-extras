  The ~rename~ block is for Textual Substitution. For example, as a translation tool:

  #+begin_rename "Allah to God, Yacoub to Jacob, Yusuf to Joseph"
  Quran 12-4: *_Yusuf_* said to his father ( _*Yacoub*_ ), /“O my father,
  indeed I have seen (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the
  moon; I saw them prostrating to me.”/
  #+end_rename

  In the rendered result, the Arabic names are replaced with their English counterparts.
