  Sometimes there is a remark or a code snippet that is useful to
  have, but not relevant to the discussion at hand and so we want to
  /fold away such [[doc:org-block/details][details]]/.

  #+begin_details Example use cases
  + ‘Conversation-style’ articles, where the author asks the reader questions
    whose answers are “folded away” so the reader can think about the exercise
    before seeing the answer.

  + Hiding boring but important code snippets, such as a list of import
    declarations or a tedious implementation.
  #+end_details

  Full syntax ~#+begin_details "title" :background-color "cyan" :title-color "green"~.

  1. The LaTex implementation requires:
     #+latex_header: \usepackage{tcolorbox}

  2. The use of quotes in the :title-color keyword is only required for the LaTeX backend.

  3. In the LaTeX implementation, We could use src_latex[:exports
     code]{\begin{quote}\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{\textbf{Details:}
     ...}}\end{quote}}; however, this does not work well with
     [[https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d#bibliography--coloured-latex-using-minted][minted]]
     for coloured source blocks. Instead, we use ~tcolorbox~.
